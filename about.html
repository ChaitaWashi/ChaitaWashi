There is also establishment of the idol of lord surya in year 2018 and for this our village organised a huge event that's surya yagya.
	which connect those youth and people to our original culture. which is very necessary
In today's world most of the people follows western culture. This types of event join us to ours culture.Yagya can't be organised by the coordination of individual this needs the coordination of whole community likely in surya yagya chaita there is participation of most of the villagers. They were collecting capital from the different village cities. Large amount of people given there economical support to as his strength.Many of them given ₹1000 and much more whose names are written on the stone which is placed in the temple premises. one of the the people given the capital for idol where another one given for construction & painting. This temple is constructed about 10 to 15 years before but it's establishment takes place in 2018. For this SANJAY MAHATMA can't be forgetten who guide the people for this event. Actually this is the second  yagya the first yagya organised in the year of 2002. it was also organised by sanjay mahatma.                   THANKING YOU.......
